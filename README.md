DecentralAI (DCAI) is a decentralized ecosystem combining **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **blockchain**, and **DeFi** to empower developers, businesses, and users. It provides tools for creating AI agents, a crypto banking platform, and scalable computational infrastructure built on the **TON blockchain** [[1]].  

---

## üìå Key Features  
1. **AI Agent Marketplace**:  
   - Create, sell, and buy AI agents via an open marketplace.  
   - API access for developers with DCAI token payments [[6]].  
2. **Crypto Bank**:  
   - Decentralized financial services: deposits, loans, and payment solutions.  
3. **Compute Infrastructure**:  
   - GPU farms (NVIDIA H100/B100) and data centers for AI model training.  
4. **DCAI Token**:  
   - Governance, staking, transaction fees, and platform access.  

---

## üß© Problem & Solution  
### **Problem**  
- Centralization of AI technologies (limited access to compute power and data).  
- High barriers for AI developers (costly infrastructure, monetization gaps).  
- Lack of DeFi tools in the TON ecosystem [[1]].  

### **Solution**  
- Decentralized platform for AI agents with open compute access.  
- Integrated DeFi via the crypto bank.  
- Transparent tokenomics with burn/buyback mechanisms [[6]].  

---

## üí∞ Tokenomics (DCAI)  
- **Total Supply**: 357,142,857 tokens.  
- **Price**: $0.1 (target raise: **$25M**).  
- **Distribution**:  
  - **60%**: Investor sale (214,285,714 tokens).  
  - **40%**: Reserve fund (142,857,143 tokens), including:  
    - 7% team (4-year lock-up).  
    - 18% ecosystem (data centers, development).  
    - 8% staking rewards.  
    - 4% marketing/airdrop.  

### **Value Mechanisms**  
1. **Burn**: 1% of API fees burned.  
2. **Buyback**: 10% of bank profits used for token buybacks.  
3. **Team Lock-Up**: 25% team tokens released annually over 4 years [[1]].

## üë• Team  
- **Founder**: 12 years of experience in software development, blockchain, and project management.  
- **Core Team**: Experts in AI, blockchain, finance, and data center operations.  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Framework  
- Company registered in **Lithuania** or **Singapore** for crypto banking compliance.  
- Obtain licenses for digital asset operations.  

---

## üì£ Marketing Strategy  
1. **Telegram**:  
   - Active community with AI/crypto analytics.  
   - AMAs with experts (e.g., NVIDIA, TON Foundation).  
2. **Partnerships**:  
   - Integrate with Tonkeeper, DeDust, and The Open Network.  
3. **Advertising**:  
   - Targeted Telegram/Twitter campaigns.  
   - Attend crypto conferences (e.g., Token2049).  

---

## üöÄ Example Use Case  
### **Developer Workflow**:  
1. Create an AI agent on DecentralAI.  
2. List it on the marketplace with a DCAI price.  
3. Buyers pay via smart contracts.  
4. Developers earn DCAI; 1% fees are burned [[6]].
